There once was a boy named Dickie. He was a MLG gamer who loved Fortnite and Mountain Dew.  One day after getting double xp from a bag of Doritos he had just eaten he was one of the last two alive and the last person was a no skin.  Was the last person TFue? Upon further investigation Dickie found out the opponent was an unlikely contender, someone who was sick of him  playing fortnite all the time. He used his superior cs skills to track the IP address of his opponent, only to find that it was the same IP address as his own.
