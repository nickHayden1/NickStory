There once was a boy named Dickie. He was a MLG gamer who loved Fortnite and Mountain Dew.  One day after getting double xp from a bag of Doritos he had just eaten he was one of the last two alive and the last person was a no skin.  Was the last person TFue? Upon further investigation Dickie found out the opponent was an unlikely contender, someone who was sick of him  playing fortnite all the time. He used his superior cs skills to track the IP address of his opponent, only to find that it was the same IP address as his own.

He turned around in his MLG GTRacing professional gamer chair with a look of utter shock on his face. He realized there was only one thing that could be happening. There must have been an elite haxor group targeting him and trying to bring down his legendary fortnite career and Mountain Dew sponsorship. He stood up in a panic and started violently unplugging all of the computers in his house. Once everything was unplugged, he finally collapsed in bed with his trusty bagel bites and mountain dew. Later that day...
