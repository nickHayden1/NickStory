There once was a boy named Dickie. He was a MLG gamer who loved Fortnite and Mountain Dew.  One day after getting double xp from a bag of Doritos he had just eaten he was one of the last two alive and the last person was a no skin.  Was the last person TFue? Upon further investigation Dickie found out the opponent was an unlikely contender, someone who was sick of him  playing fortnite all the time. He used his superior cs skills to track the IP address of his opponent, only to find that it was the same IP address as his own.

He turned around in his MLG GTRacing professional gamer chair with a look of utter shock on his face. He realized there was only one thing that could be happening. There must have been an elite haxor group targeting him and trying to bring down his legendary fortnite career and Mountain Dew sponsorship. He stood up in a panic and started violently unplugging all of the computers in his house. Once everything was unplugged, he finally collapsed in bed with his trusty bagel bites and mountain dew. Later that day...

Later that day he went onto twitter and discovered that the elite haxor group was none other than the group known as "Deb's Xteam Number 27". He couldn't believe that his pro skills were put to waste
by a bunch of friggin nerds. After undusting his chest of Dorito crumbs and began to counter hack against the the disciples of Deb. But he discovered he was powerless as the members of Xteam 27 were 
chad programmers and he was just a Fortnite scrub.

The chad programmers were sucessful in their crusade against the young boy named Dickie.
They had celebrated thier victory by drinking Mountain Dew and looking at home differet data structures worked.  The legend of Xteam 27 will go down in history as the most eliect hacking group known to man and the best Fortnite players since Tfue himself!
